Bookshelf is a simple Android application built with Jetpack Compose that allows users to browse and search for books. It uses the Google Books API to fetch and display book data, including titles, authors, and cover images. Users can view details about each book, such as descriptions and publisher information. The app features a search bar for finding books by title or author, and a history of recent searches.

Bookshelf is a great example of how to use Jetpack Compose to create a modern and responsive user interface.
